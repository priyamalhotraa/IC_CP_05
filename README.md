C++ Student Management System – Task 5 assigned by Interncred

## Student Management System (C++)

This repository contains a console-based Student Management System developed in C++  
as part of Task 5 assigned by Interncred during the internship.

The system allows secure login for admin/teacher accounts and provides full  
student record management, including adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and  
searching student records. It also calculates total marks, percentage, grade,  
and pass/fail status for each student.

## Features
- Secure Admin/Teacher Login with multiple accounts
- Add, View, Update, and Delete student records
- Search by Roll Number
- Sort student records by Roll Number
- Automatically calculates total marks, percentage, grade, and pass/fail
- Attendance tracking
- File handling for persistent storage

## How It Works
1. Login with valid credentials:
   - Admin: username `admin`, password `123`
   - Teacher: username `teacher`, password `456`
2. Menu-driven interface:
   - Add new students
   - View all student records
   - Update existing records
   - Delete a student record
   - Search by roll number
   - Sort records by roll number
   - Exit the system

## Concepts Covered
- File handling (binary)
- Structures
- Arrays and vectors
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and modular programming
- Sorting algorithms
- Basic console I/O operations

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ student_management.cpp -o student_mgmt

2. Run the program:
  - On Linux / Mac:
   ./student_management
